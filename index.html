Tasmanian Context
Tasmania is recognized globally for its unique biodiversity and significant conservation
values. The island's geographic isolation has resulted in high levels of endemism, with
many species found nowhere else on Earth. Tasmania contains approximately:
 
• 44% of Australia's threatened native vegetation communities
• Important populations of threatened species including the Tasmanian devil, wedge-tailed
eagle, and orange-bellied parrot
• World Heritage Areas covering approximately 1.58 million hectares
• Extensive wilderness areas of global significance
This project contributes to the protection and management of these important natural
values in the face of ongoing threats from climate change, invasive species, and habitat
modification.

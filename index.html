I can see the issue! The problem is in the age calculation for the dependents. The ages are showing as 1617, 1817, 2017 which means there's a calculation error. Let me fix this:

FIND THIS FUNCTION (around line 940):

```javascript
function updateScenarioContext(scenarioAge, yearsToRetirement, expenseData) {
    let contextText = `At age ${scenarioAge}, `;
    
    if (expenseData.dependentsAtRetirement.length > 0) {
        const dependentAges = expenseData.dependentsAtRetirement.map(dep => {
            const ageAtRetirement = dep.age + yearsToRetirement;
            return `${dep.name} (age ${ageAtRetirement})`;
        });
        
        contextText += `you'll still have ${expenseData.dependentsAtRetirement.length} dependent${expenseData.dependentsAtRetirement.length > 1 ? 's' : ''} at home: ${dependentAges.join(', ')}. `;
        
        // Add education context if applicable
        if (expenseData.remainingEducationCosts > 0) {
            contextText += `Education costs will continue for some dependents. `;
        }
    } else {
        contextText += `all your dependents will have left home. Your household expenses will be significantly lower. `;
    }
    
    contextText += `Your household expenses are projected to be ${formatCurrency(expenseData.retirementExpenses)} annually.`;
    return contextText;
}
```

REPLACE IT WITH THIS:

```javascript
function updateScenarioContext(scenarioAge, yearsToRetirement, expenseData) {
    let contextText = `At age ${scenarioAge}, `;
    
    if (expenseData.dependentsAtRetirement.length > 0) {
        const dependentAges = expenseData.dependentsAtRetirement.map(dep => {
            const ageAtRetirement = parseInt(dep.age) + parseInt(yearsToRetirement);
            return `${dep.name} (age ${ageAtRetirement})`;
        });
        
        contextText += `you'll still have ${expenseData.dependentsAtRetirement.length} dependent${expenseData.dependentsAtRetirement.length > 1 ? 's' : ''} at home: ${dependentAges.join(', ')}. `;
        
        // Add education context if applicable
        if (expenseData.remainingEducationCosts > 0) {
            contextText += `Education costs will continue for some dependents. `;
        }
    } else {
        contextText += `all your dependents will have left home. Your household expenses will be significantly lower. `;
    }
    
    contextText += `Your household expenses are projected to be ${formatCurrency(expenseData.retirementExpenses)} annually.`;
    return contextText;
}
```

ALSO, let's fix the main filtering logic. FIND THIS PART in the calculateRetirementExpensesWithDependents function:

```javascript
// FIXED: Properly calculate which dependents will still be at home at retirement
const dependentsAtRetirement = dependents.filter(dep => {
    const ageAtRetirement = dep.age + yearsToRetirement;
    // A dependent is considered "at home" if they haven't reached their supportUntil age
    // AND they're still in education or below typical leaving age (usually 18-22)
    return ageAtRetirement < dep.supportUntil;
});
```

REPLACE IT WITH THIS:

```javascript
// FIXED: Properly calculate which dependents will still be at home at retirement
const dependentsAtRetirement = dependents.filter(dep => {
    const ageAtRetirement = parseInt(dep.age) + parseInt(yearsToRetirement);
    const supportUntilAge = parseInt(dep.supportUntil);
    // A dependent is considered "at home" if they haven't reached their supportUntil age
    return ageAtRetirement < supportUntilAge;
});
```

AND ALSO FIX the education cost calculation in the same function:

```javascript
// FIXED: Calculate remaining education costs more accurately
let remainingEducationCosts = 0;
dependents.forEach(dep => {
    const ageAtRetirement = parseInt(dep.age) + parseInt(yearsToRetirement);
    const supportUntilAge = parseInt(dep.supportUntil);
    
    // Only count education costs if the dependent is still in education at retirement
    if (ageAtRetirement < supportUntilAge) {
        if (dep.educationType === 'secondary' && ageAtRetirement < 18) {
            // Full secondary education costs
            remainingEducationCosts += educationCosts / dependents.length;
        } else if ((dep.educationType === 'university' || dep.educationType === 'tafe') && ageAtRetirement < supportUntilAge) {
            // Tertiary education costs (typically lower than full household costs)
            remainingEducationCosts += (educationCosts / dependents.length) * 0.7;
        }
    }
});
```

The main issues were:

1. String concatenation instead of number addition: The ages were being treated as strings and concatenated instead of added as numbers (e.g., "16" + "17" = "1617" instead of 16 + 17 = 33).
2. Missing parseInt(): We need to explicitly convert the age values to numbers using parseInt().
3. Simplified logic: The filtering logic was getting confused with the string values.

These fixes should resolve the age calculation issue and give you proper ages like "Child 1 (age 33)" instead of "Child 1 (age 1617)".
